# GW Instek Screen Capture (gwicap)

This is a simple UI to enable a user to save data from a GW Instek Oscilloscope (tested with a GDS-1102-U). The frontend has been built with [DearPyGUI](https://github.com/hoffstadt/DearPyGui) and serial connection to the oscilloscope is achieved with [PySerial](https://github.com/pyserial/pyserial).
